# Time series deeplearning
### Exploring methods and techniques of deep learning with TensorFlow.Keras for apply time series in datas.

#### Was intended in the experiment 1 just learning comportment of LSTM, what is a Recurrent Neural Network, nomrmaly applied in NLP problems, but meeto  used in time series. 

#### In the second experiment, deep learning is being applied with tf.keras, using official documentation such as td.data.Dataset and other manipulation attributes of this library; In addition, some data visualizations more suitable for time series are better detailed.
